# local-media-share-classes

This is a program designed to allow bit media sharing for Twitch.tv streamers. Simply change the relevant information in Settings.py and start 'er up.

Features:
---------
Queue system - videos cheered in chat are handled and played in the order they were submitted

Bits per second - you can change the bits needed to play a second of media in the settings file

In the future, I will add support for media sharing upon receiving subscribers, gift subs, and donations, as well as perhaps implementing a system where the program remembers that a user cheered and allows them to submit a video at a later time.
